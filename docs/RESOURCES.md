## Recommended Learning Resources

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Elixir for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [Elixir Getting Started Guide](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html)
* [Elixir Documentation](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/)
* [Programming Elixir](http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir), by Dave Thomas
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elixir)
